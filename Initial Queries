-- 1. Previewing the data

/*
SELECT 
  *
FROM 
  covid.deaths
ORDER BY 3,4
*/

-- 2. Selecting the data to use.

/*
SELECT 
  location, date, total_cases, new_cases, total_deaths, population
FROM 
  covid.deaths
ORDER BY
  1,2
*/

-- 3. Looking at the time frame of the data

/*
SELECT MAX(date) AS latest_recorded, MIN(date) AS earlisted_recorded
FROM covid.deaths
*/

-- 4. Looking at deaths as a percentage of cases

/*
SELECT 
  location, date, total_cases, total_deaths, (total_deaths/total_cases)*100 AS DeathPercentage
FROM 
  covid.deaths
WHERE 
  location like "%United States%" AND continent is not null

-- 5. Looking at total cases as a percentage of population

/*
SELECT
  location, date, total_cases, Population, (total_cases/population)*100 AS CasePercentage
FROM 
  covid.deaths
--WHERE 
  --location like "%United States%" AND continent is not null

-- 6. Looking at countries with highest infection rate for the population

/*
SELECT
  location, Population, MAX(total_cases) AS HighestInfectionCount, MAX((total_cases/population))*100 AS MaxCasePercentage
FROM 
  covid.deaths
WHERE 
  continent is not null

ORDER BY CasePercentage DESC
*/

-- 7. Showing countries with the highest death count and deaths per capita

/*
SELECT
  location, MAX(cast(total_deaths as int)) AS TotalDeathCount, MAX(total_deaths/population)*100 AS MaxDeathPercentage
FROM 
  covid.deaths
WHERE

-- 8. Showing continents with the highest death count and deaths per capita

/*
SELECT
  continent, MAX(cast(total_deaths as int)) AS TotalDeathCount, MAX((total_deaths/population))*100 AS MaxDeathPercentage
FROM 
  covid.deaths
WHERE 
  continent is not null
GROUP BY continent, Population

-- 9. Global death rate

/*
SELECT
  SUM(new_cases) AS total_cases, SUM(cast(new_deaths as int)) as total_deaths, SUM(cast(new_deaths as int))/SUM(new_cases)*100 
  AS GlobalDeathRate
FROM
  covid.deaths
*/

-- 10. Joining deaths and vaccination tables to produce a rolling vaccination count and percentage

/*
